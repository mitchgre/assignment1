# Programming Background 

  - Started programming in BASIC in the early 1980s on various machines including an Apple II and a Texas Instruments 99.  Studied Hypercard on early Macintosh versions in high school. 

  - Took a long break before trying to pick up random languages such as C++ and HTML, in the late 1990s. 

  - Currently working on a commandline text editor implemented in multiple languages. Currently this is C++, C, GLIB, PHP, Python, Java, and node.js.  Each of these uses the ncurses library.  The most complete so far is the C++ version, though the python version is catching up and surpassing. 

  - Was working on an AJAX text editor utilizing jQuery on a LAMP stack before starting the 1-year track of Oregon State University's CS program last September (2014).  Hoping to pick that up again this term (Winter 2015).  The difficulties so far lie in security.
